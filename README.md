# mycustomers

## Work on this Project with the following rules

1. The app will be using  “Flutter ScreenUtil” package to ensure the app design is consistent across all mobile devices.

2. The app will be developed using “Stacked” architecture.

3. The app will be using Travis CI/Code Magic for CI/CD, to checkmate when develop, so as bugs or errors don’t be added to the repo.

4. The layout of the codebase will just implement stacked architecture.

5. **NO STATEFUL WIDGET!** {We will be using reactive and non reactive Extended classes}

6. EVERYTHING MUST BE TESTED FROM  **UNIT | INTEGRATION | SOME WIDGETS.**

7. The app will use Responsive Builder package to ensure responsiveness across all screens.

8. The app will debug with Device Preview and ensure each screen MEET all screen size.
